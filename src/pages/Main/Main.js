            <p className="sectionTitle">Why American Sign Language?</p>
            <p className="sectionBody">
              American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual gestural language created
              by those with speaking and hearing disabilities. The language has
              approximately 500,000 speakers around the world! Despite being
              able to communicate, ASL speakers struggle to feel included in
              society due to their differences. Not many people may understand
              how to communicate in the language. Learning ASL could help reduce
              the struggle those with disabilities face!
